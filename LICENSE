DATASET CITATION

This software is designed to work with the Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset:

Weber, M., Domeniconi, G., Chen, J., Weidele, D. K. I., Bellei, C.,
Robinson, T., & Leiserson, C. E. (2019). Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin:
Experimenting with Graph Convolutional Networks for Financial Forensics.
In KDD Workshop on Anomaly Detection in Finance.

Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set

The dataset is provided under its own terms and conditions. Please review and
comply with the dataset's license when using it with this software.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE NOTICE

This software is designed to assist with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance
and is intended for use in accordance with:

- EU Artificial Intelligence Act, Article 13 (Transparency Requirements)
- Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendation 16
- Applicable local, national, and international AML regulations

Users are responsible for ensuring their use of this software complies with
all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.

This software provides AI-generated risk assessments and explanations for
informational and decision-support purposes only. Human review and judgment
remain essential components of effective AML compliance programs.

================================================================================

PATENT NOTICE

This software has been designed to avoid known patented methods in the
cryptocurrency AML detection space. However, the field is rapidly evolving,
and users should conduct their own patent searches and legal reviews to
ensure compliance with applicable intellectual property laws.

The following specific design choices were made to avoid known patents:

1. Uses template-based explanation generation (not "narrative generation")
   to avoid potential conflict with PayPal US11682018B2

2. Uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) instead of plain Graph Convolutional
   Networks (GCN) to differentiate from CN111311416A

3. Multi-scale temporal attention mechanism is novel and differs from
   existing temporal knowledge graph approaches (US20220020026A1)

Users implementing this software in commercial settings should consult with
intellectual property counsel.
